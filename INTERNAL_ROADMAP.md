# Internal Roadmap - React Debugging Problems to Solve

This document outlines the key problems in React debugging that our tool should address.

## 1. Hard to See Component Lifecycle Events

**Problem:** Developers can't easily visualize when components mount, update, or unmount in a timeline.

**Impact:** Unnecessary or wasted re-renders are buried in raw profiler data.

---

## 2. State Mutation is a Black Box

**Problem:** It's unclear where/why state changes happen.

**Impact:** No clear mapping from an action (like a button click) → state change → re-rendered components.

---

## 3. Hook Dependency Misuse

**Problem:** Easy to forget dependencies in useEffect / useMemo / useCallback.

**Impact:** Adding/removing dependencies can cause infinite loops or stale data, and runtime behavior is hard to debug.

---

## 4. Async Flow is Invisible

**Problem:** Promises, cancellations, and stale async updates aren't visible.

**Impact:** Developers struggle to debug issues like updating an unmounted component.

---

## 5. Render Frequency is Opaque

**Problem:** Developers don't know which components are re-rendering too often.

**Impact:** Profiler graphs are hard to interpret, making optimization guesswork.

---

## 6. Bundle Size Origins Are Unclear

**Problem:** Current bundle analyzers show what is big, but not why.

**Impact:** 
- It's hard to know which component or dependency introduced heavy libraries
- Developers don't know which import decision caused major bundle growth
- Guidance on alternatives is missing

---

## 7. Suspense Data Waterfalls Go Unnoticed

**Problem:** Devs can't see when Suspense blocks rendering due to sequential fetches.

**Impact:** Waterfalls reduce performance, but diagnosing them is tricky.

---

## 8. Predicting Unnecessary Re-renders is Difficult

**Problem:** No proactive warnings about components that will re-render unnecessarily.

**Impact:** Optimizations like React.memo or useMemo are often applied blindly.

---

## 9. State History is Non-Traceable

**Problem:** React state (local or global) changes over time aren't easy to replay or debug.

**Impact:** Devs can't scrub through history to see what caused a bug.

---

## 10. Profiler Data is Too Low-Level

**Problem:** Raw React profiler traces are difficult to read.

**Impact:** Devs need human-readable summaries of "what's slow and why."

---

## 11. Debugging is Not Conversational

**Problem:** No way to ask questions like "Why is this component slow?" directly in devtools.

**Impact:** Developers want interactive, AI-powered guidance instead of raw data dumps.

---

## 12. State Debugging Lacks Explanations

**Problem:** Even if state history is recorded, devs don't know why a specific change caused a bug.

**Impact:** Need explanations for differences between states (step X vs step Y).

---

## 13. User Experience Metrics Aren't Correlated with Components

**Problem:** Paint timings, layout shifts, and input delays are collected (via Web Vitals), but not mapped to specific React components.

**Impact:** Developers don't know which component caused a poor UX metric.

---

## 14. Parallel vs Sequential API Calls Are Hidden

**Problem:** Developers often unknowingly make sequential network calls.

**Impact:** There's no tool showing opportunities for parallelization.

---

## 15. No Clear Link Between Analytics & Performance

**Problem:** Predictive prefetching (like Google Analytics–style insights) exists, but isn't tied to component usage patterns.

**Impact:** Developers don't know what to prefetch or optimize for actual user behavior.

---

## 16. Event Propagation is Invisible

**Problem:** React synthetic events bubble and trigger handlers, but developers can't trace which component's handler fired and in what order.

**Impact:** Debugging complex UIs with nested event handlers becomes guesswork.

---

## 17. CSS-in-JS Debugging is Opaque

**Problem:** It's not clear which React component generated which style rule.

**Impact:** Styling bugs are hard to trace back to their source.

---

## 18. Scoping for Dev Inspection and Component Lifecycle Debugging

**Problem:** Limited scoping mechanisms for focused debugging of specific components or lifecycle events.

**Impact:** Developers need better tools for targeted inspection and lifecycle debugging.
